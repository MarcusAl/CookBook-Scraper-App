Kalbi (Korean BBQ Short Ribs): Authentic Recipe,"After trying many recipes for homemade-style Korean BBQ, I finally found a great recipe from a friend who learned it from his mom. It's sweet, salty, spicy, and very tender (Thanks to the CokeÂ®). I use this same recipe to make Bulgogi and Dae Ji Bool Gogi (Spicy Pork) and simply change the onions to sliced bulbs for the bulgogi.",Rating: 4.5 stars,"",[]
